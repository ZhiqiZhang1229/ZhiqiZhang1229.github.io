Hi! This is Zhiqi Zhang. I am a Ph.D. candidate majoring in Supply Chain, Operations, and Technology at Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis (WashU). 

My research interests lie in platform operations, machine learning, causal inference, and so on. I am advised by Professor [Dennis Zhang](http://denniszhang.org/?).

**I will be on the 2025-2026 academic job market for a tenure-track faculty position.**
